An exciting little bit of code that can recommend what yarn to use! 
I'm starting with recommendations for specific patterns, and plan to expanded it to recommend substitution for any yarn

working my way through the Project Euler problems.

Learning more about:
* SQL 
* APIs and how to build them
* building GIUs with tkinter, Kivy, and WxPython

I'm delighted to chat about:

## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
* obscure Python details
